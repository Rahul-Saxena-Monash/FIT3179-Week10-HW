                <h2>pH Deviation Map</h2>
                <p>This map shows the deviation of pH in the ocean surrounding Australia from the global average in 2013.</p>
                <p>The pH deviation is measured using the pH scale, where a deviation of 0 is the global average. The positive deviations (more basic) are in red, and the negative deviations (more acidic) are in blue.</p>

                <h2>Ocean Acidification Time Series</h2>
                <p>This time series chart illustrates the changes in key variables related to ocean acidification over time. Use the dropdown menu to select different variables:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>pH:</strong> Measures acidity. A decreasing pH indicates increasing acidity, which can harm marine organisms, especially those with calcium carbonate shells or skeletons.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sea Surface Temperature (SST):</strong> Rising temperatures can accelerate chemical reactions and reduce the ocean's capacity to absorb CO2, exacerbating acidification.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sea Surface Salinity (SSS):</strong> Changes in salinity can affect the ocean's ability to absorb CO2 and impact marine ecosystems.</li>
                    <li><strong>Aragonite Saturation State (OMEGA_A):</strong> A decreasing value indicates it's harder for marine organisms to form aragonite shells, crucial for many species' survival.</li>
                    <li><strong>Calcite Saturation State (OMEGA_C):</strong> Similar to aragonite, a lower value makes it more difficult for organisms to form calcite shells, affecting various marine species.</li>
                </ul>
